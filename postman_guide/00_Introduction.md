# ZATCA Postman Collection

This directory provides a step-by-step guide for testing the ZATCA E-Invoicing integration.

## 📥 Import the Collection

A pre-configured Postman Collection is available for direct import:

[zatca_einvoicing_collection.json](file:///Users/macbook/Documents/Hala Tech/Zatca/zatca-einvoicing-core/zatca_einvoicing_collection.json)

### How to use:

1. Open Postman.
2. Click **Import**.
3. Drag and drop the `zatca_einvoicing_collection.json` file.
4. Set the `base_url` variable in the collection settings (default is `http://localhost:3000`).

## 🧪 Testing Flow

1. **01: CSR Generation**: Create your private key and CSR.
2. **02: Get Compliance CSID**: Exchange CSR for a certificate.
3. **03-07: Signing**: Generate signed XMLs for various invoice types.
4. **08: Compliance Check**: Validate your signed XML with ZATCA.
